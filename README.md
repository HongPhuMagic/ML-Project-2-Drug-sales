With Linear regression (54% accuracy), polynomial regression, and gradient boosting (99% accuracy) as the best three performing models.

#### Project Goal

The goal for this project was to build regression models that can be used to predict future drug sales of:
* N02BA - Analgesics and antipyretics, Salicylic acid and derivatives

* Apply regression machine learning algorithms:
    * Linear Regression
    * Polynomial Regression
    * SVR
    * Gradient boosting
    * Random Foresting Regression
